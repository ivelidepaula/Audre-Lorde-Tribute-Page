      <p>Born in 1934, Audre Lorde was a <b>writer</b>, <b>feminist</b> and <b>civil rights activist</b>. She was a memorable activist and one of her most notable efforts was her militant work with Afro-German women in the 1980s. Within the feminist movement did she have much support, for she pointed to the weaknesses of this movement and the need to deal with questions concerning <b>the reality of black women</b>, which were completely ignored. She became a lonely black lesbian voice inside the feminist movement, pointing out the oppression that white women were submitting black women and later became one of the forerunners of the intersectional feminist movement.</p>
     <p>She used to describe herself like this: <b>"I am defined as the other in all the groups that I participate in. The outsider, both by strength and weakness."</b> Her poetry is strong and reflects internal and external conflicts arising from her status as a black woman in a society marked by sexism and racism.</p>

        <p>&quot;and when we speak we are afraid</p>
        <p>our words will not be heard</p>

        <p>but when we are silent</p>
        <p>we are still afraid</p>
        <p>So it is better to speak</p>
